# Decapital Submission Reviewer

A small tool that grabs Decapital submissions from a Google Sheet and formats it nicely for reviewing.

NB: This tool only works if you have permissions to view the document. Otherwise you'll get a flood of errors.

## Local Development

The current Client ID and API key are set to work on `waltz.github.io` and `localhost:8000`.
To preview the app locally use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the project root directory.`
